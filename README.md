# Near Duplicate Image Detector

This project has the CUDA implementation of [perceptual hashing algorithms](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/index.php?/archives/432-Looks-Like-It.html) like [dHashing](http://www.hackerfactor.com/blog/?/archives/529-Kind-of-Like-That.html).

## Dependencies
1. CUDA 8.1 or better
2. OpenCV 3.3.0 vc-14

## Usage
Make sure OpenCV install directory (which is usually `C:\OpenCV-3.3.0-vc14\opencv\build` is set to `%OPENCV_DIR%` in environment variables)

Read the `README.md` of the front-end for more information
